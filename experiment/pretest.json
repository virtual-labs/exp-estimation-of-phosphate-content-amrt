      "question": "Which of the following is a tribasic acid?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Acetic acid",
        "b": "Phosphoric acid",
        "c": "Sulphuric acid",
        "d": "Benzoic acid"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Acetic acid is monobasic, as it has only one replaceable hydrogen.",
        "b": "Phosphoric acid is tribasic because it has three replaceable hydrogen atoms.",
        "c": "Sulphuric acid is dibasic.",
        "d": "Benzoic acid is monobasic."

      "question": "A colorimeter measures",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Light that passes through the substance",
        "b": "Light given off by the substance",
        "c": "Change in wave length of light by the substance",
        "d": "Light that is fluoresced by the substance"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct – A colorimeter measures the amount of light transmitted through a solution.",
        "b": "Incorrect – This describes emission spectroscopy.",
        "c": "Incorrect – Wavelength change is not what colorimeters detect.",
        "d": "Incorrect – This describes fluorescence spectrometry."
