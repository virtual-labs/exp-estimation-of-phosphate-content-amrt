        "d": "Benzoic acid"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Acetic acid is monobasic, as it has only one replaceable hydrogen.",
        "b": "Phosphoric acid is tribasic because it has three replaceable hydrogen atoms.",
        "c": "Sulphuric acid is dibasic.",
        "d": "Benzoic acid is monobasic."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect – Losing electrons means oxidation, not reduction.",
        "b": "Correct – A reducing agent loses electrons and reduces another substance.",
        "c": "Incorrect – This describes an oxidizing agent.",
        "d": "Incorrect – This describes a reduced substance, not a reducing agent."
