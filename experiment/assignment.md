    Which of the following statements about the absorbance of a compound in a colorimeter is correct?
    <ul>
      <li>a) The absorbance will double if the concentration of the colored compound is doubled.</li>
      <li>b) The absorbance will double if the concentration of the colored compound is halved.</li>
      <li>c) The absorbance does not depend on the concentration of the colored compound.</li>
      <li>d) The absorbance is highest for light of the same colour as that of the solution.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Why is it generally preferable to use absorbance as a measure of absorption rather than % Transmittance?
    <ul>
      <li>a) Because %T cannot be measured as accurately as absorbance</li>
      <li>b) Because %T is dependant on the power of the incident radiation</li>
      <li>c) Because absorbance is proportional to the concentration of the analyte, whereas %T is not.</li>
    </ul>

    The blank for a colorimeter should be composed of
    <ul>
      <li>a) Water</li>
      <li>b) Empty cuvette</li>
      <li>c) Test solution</li>
      <li>d) Everything except the compound of interest which absorbs light</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Using a standard curve, if you know the absorbance of an unknown sample, what else can be determined about the unknown?
    <ul>
      <li>a) The wave length of the maximum absorbance</li>
      <li>b) The molecular weight of the sample</li>
      <li>c) The concentration of the sample</li>
      <li>d) The identity of the sample</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
