      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect – Absorbitivity is not a standard term here.",
        "b": "Incorrect – Path length is represented by 'l'.",
        "c": "Correct – ε is the molar absorptivity (or molar extinction coefficient).",

      "question": "Theoretically, a reducing agent can be described as a substance that",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Loses electrons and becomes reduced.",
        "b": "Loses electrons and causes reduction.",
        "c": "Gains electrons and causes oxidation.",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect – Losing electrons means oxidation, not reduction.",
        "b": "Correct – A reducing agent loses electrons and reduces another substance.",
        "c": "Incorrect – This describes an oxidizing agent.",
